 This code activates anytime someone leaves or joins a voice channel. It checks if the channel that was left has any people left. If there isn't, it automatically deletes the channel keep the server nice and clean.

Hitting any of the reactions under the messages automatically gives you the roles assigned to them rather than manually giving everyone each role.
